# .dotfiles
These the dotfiles that I use in daily life on macOS and sometimes on linux!

## What editor do I use?
I use [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I have began the transition from Cursor -> Zed since Zed introduced Remote Project development in their recent betas.

## What terminal do I use?
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)! It has been really nice to use, and I have been using it for a long time at this point. I would highly recommned checking it out.

# Credits
A lot of the nvim setup was taken from [lazy.nvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). It is a super good setup to get started with and I would totally recommend it to anyone new like me.
