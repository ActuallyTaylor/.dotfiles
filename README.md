# .dotfiles
These the dotfiles that I use in daily life on macOS and sometimes on linux!

## MacOS
On macOS I use the [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) window manager for keyboard based navigation throughout my space and windows. For code editors I use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) and [NeoVim](https://neovim.io).

I also have a script that sits in my custom menu bar that will set the theme depending on the macOS appearance mode.

## What terminal do I use?
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)! It has been really nice to use, and I have been using it for al ong time at this point. I would highly recommned checking it out.

## What editor do I use?
I mostly do not use a command line editor, my primary editor is usually [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium). However when I am working in situations that require one (college courses), I prefer to use [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) which I have modified to fit my liking.
