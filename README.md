# .dotfiles
These the dotfiles that I use in daily life on macOS.

## What terminal do I use?
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)! It has been really nice to use, and I have been using it for al ong time at this point. I would highly recommned checking it out.

## What editor do I use?
I mostly do not use a command line editor. However when I am working in situations that require one (college courses), I prefer to use VIM which I have modified to fit my liking.
